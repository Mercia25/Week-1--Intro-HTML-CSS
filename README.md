📸📸📸Images

📸When we want to add an image to a webpage, we use the image element, which is simply written as IMG. 
📸Here is the cool part: there are four attributes that need to be included for every image. 

1.First, we have the source attribute (SRC), which tells the browser which image file to load. 
2.Then we have the alt attribute (ALT), which provides a text description of the image. 
3.Lastly, we have the width and height attributes, which determine the size of the image. So, every image should have all four of these attributes.

NOTE
It does not matter whether the height or the width is specified first. In HTML, the order of attributes within an element can be whatever you prefer.
